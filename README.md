# CSC 309 Project
Welcome to DogWorld! <br>
Creators: Jemma Arona, Riya Badadare, Saylor Benes, Andy Duong,
Aayush Joshi, and Molly Sandler!

<br>
<b> Deployment! </b>
<br>
To run our project, you simply download the jar file available under "Releases."
This can then be run by going into your terminal and running this command:
java -jar {name of jar} in the location where the jar file is stored.

This project has some unique features! They are outlined down below.

<b> Game Functionality: </b><br>
This is a game with a drag and drop similar to Scratch. You will look at the 
level you are on, and try to match the spiders path and paint colors to the
one displayed by dragging the commands into the command panel. There are 
simple step and turn blocks, as well as more complicated branch and loop blocks
to make the setup easier. Every paint block has a dropdown bar to determine which
color paint you want to do. Some colors involve mixing multiple colors, and 
every path you run is scored. The more efficient the path and the more 
accurate your paint mixing is, the higher your score will be and the more coins you will earn!
You can use these coins to purchase different avatars for the game in our shop.
<br>

<b> Sandbox Functionality: </b> <br>
You can create your own levels too! In our sandbox mode you can test things out, and
if you like what you make you can save it to replay later on! You drag and drop your
own diamonds to the locations you want, then click save to store them with a custom name.
<br>

<b> Bluetooth Dog Robot: </b> <br>
We have an option to connect a robotic dog  via bluetooth to the project as well. 
This dog follows the commands given to the avatar to follow, in sync with the avatar itself.
This portion of the code is commented out, but could be added back at any time. One 
of our future enhancements for this project will be adding a GUI feature to select if
you have the dog connected or not, instead of just commenting the code. 
<br>

<b> Code Organization </b>
<br>
Everything pertaining to the robotic portion of the code is contained in the folder
called "Dog" within the java folder. The setup for each level is contained in the 
"Levels" folder within the java folder. Everything else is loose in the java folder. 
Everything is run through the Driver class. 


We are using Maven, G4P, and PApplet to create this project.
If you have any suggestions for enhancements please don't hesitate to contact us!
